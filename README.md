This is my first java project for my courses. First semester project at [University of Tours](https://www.univ-tours.fr).

## The goal

Building a java app from scratch using Swing in order to manage the patients who need some medical devices.

## Note

Their is one issue : due to the nature of swing and my will to build a dynamic ui, there is too much reloading of the interface which cause an overflow of the AWTQueue when to many actions are performed... To fix this, I just display a message at every action.
